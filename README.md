# MovieFlix
•	Created MovieFlix project similar to NetFlix using Angular1.

•	Designed using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap3.

•	I took this as a learning opportunity to learn AngularJS and implemented this project.

•	I had used basic SignIn and SignUp page for validation for any user.

•	I had used 2 controllers admin.js and browse.js and services are implemented using catalogService.js
